# tiny-dos
Tiny-DOS is a minimalistic, modular 16-bit DOS-like operating system for educational purposes.

## Progress

- ✅ **Bootloader**: Successfully displays "HELLO, WORLD!" on boot.
- ✅ **Kernel**: Successfully transitions into the kernel, overcoming the 512-byte bootloader limit.
- ✅ **Mini OS**: The initial working version of the micro-system with the following features:
    - User login and authentication
    - Command prompt displaying based on user type (`root` or regular user)

## TODO

- ⬜ Enhance the command line functionality: ensure that pressing Enter properly displays the next command prompt, allowing for continuous user input.
